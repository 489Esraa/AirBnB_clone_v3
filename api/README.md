what is the blueprint module in flask ?

-- In Flask, the Blueprint module is used to organize your application into smaller and reusable components. A Blueprint is essentially a way to create modular applications. It allows you to define application components and associated routing and view logic separately, and then register these components on the main application.
 
--Benefits of Using Blueprints

Modularity: It helps in breaking down a large application into smaller, manageable pieces.
Reusability: Blueprints can be reused across different projects.
Organization: It keeps your code organized by separating routes and logic for different parts of the application.
